You also can contact us through the ClipBucket Help Center  or by emailing us directly without having to register for an account.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Your ClipBucket Account.</strong> For some activities on ClipBucket, like uploading videos, posting  comments, flagging videos, or watching restricted videos, you need a  ClipBucket or PHPBucket Account. We ask for some personal information when  you create an account, including your email address and a password,  which is used to protect your account from unauthorized access. A  PHPBucket Account, additionally, allows you to access other PHPBucket  services that require registration.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Usage Information.</strong> When you use ClipBucket, we may record information about your usage of the  site, such as the channels, groups and favorites you subscribe to,  which other users you communicate with, the videos you watch, the  frequency and size of data transfers, and information you display about  yourself as well as information you click on in ClipBucket (including UI  elements, settings). If you are logged in, we may associate that  information with your ClipBucket Account. In order to ensure the quality  of our service to you, we may place a tag (also called a "web beacon")  in HTML-based customer support emails or other communications with you  in order to confirm delivery.</li>\r\n  <li><strong>Content Uploaded to Site.</strong> Any personal information or video content that you voluntarily disclose  online (e.g., video comments, your profile page) may be collected and  used by others. If you download the ClipBucket Uploader, your copy  includes a unique application number. This number, and information  about your installation of the Uploader (version number, language) will  be sent to ClipBucket when the Uploader automatically checks for updates  and will be used to update your version of the Uploader.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Uses</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>If  you submit personal information to ClipBucket, we may use that information  to operate, maintain, and improve the features and functionality of  ClipBucket, and to process any flagging activity or other communication  you send to us.</li>\r\n  <li>We do not use your  email address or other personal information to send commercial or  marketing messages without your consent. We may use your email address  without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes  (such as notifying you of major ClipBucket changes or for customer service  purposes). You also can choose how often ClipBucket sends you email  updates in your ClipBucket Account settings page.</li>\r\n  <li>We  use cookies, web beacons, and log file information to: (a) store  information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit  or the next time you visit ClipBucket; (b) provide custom, personalized  content and information; (c) monitor the effectiveness of our marketing  campaigns; (d) monitor aggregate metrics such as total number of  visitors and pages viewed; and (e) track your entries, submissions, and  status in promotions, sweepstakes, and contests.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h2>Information That is Publicly Available</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n  <li>When  you create a ClipBucket Account, some information about your ClipBucket  Account and your account activity will be provided to other users of  ClipBucket.

If you choose to add  certain features to your ClipBucket Account channel page, then these  features and your activity associated with these features will be  displayed to other users and may be aggregated and shared with your  friends or other users.
